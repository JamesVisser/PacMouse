# PacMouse
This project is called PacMouse. The application uses an illustrated mouse head and a moving ghost. 
The project demonstrates the use of Z axis and also movement of an illustrated image across the screen. 
Click on the mouse head and watch him start chomping. The more clicks the mouse gets the faster he moves.
The code uses edging so when the mouse hits the edge the illustration will reverse the image.
Images were drawn by myself using Illustrator and Affinity software. The coding is a compilation of functions I 
studied in previouse educational projects at MIT. 
I am currently uncertain about the future of the program as the sky is the limit as I will wait to see what I 
learn next and implement a whole new world.
